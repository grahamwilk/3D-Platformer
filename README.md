# 3D-Platformer
repository for a 3D Platformer created in CIS-122

What I learned while making this:
* Learned how to code with Unity.
* Applied concepts learned in Linear Algebra & Physics to create game physics with C# code.
* Learned how to work with a team to create a quality product.
* Improved my skills with logic and coding significantly through coding C# scripts to be used within the game.
